{"name":"Rfunctions","tagline":"A collection of my R functions for different purposes. ","body":"### My collection of R functions\r\n\r\nThis is my collection of useful R functions. Most of them have to do with survival and reduced rank models. See my papers in Stat Med for more details. There are also a couple of functions on b-spline bases, written by Paul Eilers and a few that define ggplot2 themes (don't remember the author, I think that they can be found on CRAN now under ggthemes). \r\n\r\nTo load a particular function in R, copy the raw code url into the R code below: \r\n\r\n```{r,eval=FALSE}\r\nsource_https <- function(url, ...) {\r\n  # load package\r\n  require(RCurl)\r\n   # parse and evaluate each .R script\r\n  sapply(c(url, ...), function(u) {\r\n    eval(parse(text = getURL(u, followlocation = TRUE, cainfo = system.file(\"CurlSSL\",\"cacert.pem\", package = \"RCurl\"))), envir = .GlobalEnv)\r\n  })\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Survival Functions List: \r\n\r\n - [coxvc.R]( ): The original reduced rank hazard regression package\r\n - [coxvcf.R]( ): Reduced rank hazard regression with fixed and dynamic covariates (Perperoglou 2014)\r\n - [HyR-beta.R](): Hybrid rank=1 model, not tested, not published yet\r\n - [dynpred.R](): Dynamic prediction according to van Houwelingen, Putther (2012)\r\n - [expand.R](): The good old expand.breakpoints function. Depreciated...\r\n - [logrankp.R](): logrank test for more than two groups. \r\n### B-splines list: \r\n - [bases.R](): Creates several spline bases, written by Paul Eilers\r\n - [ps_normal.R](): More splines from Paul\r\n - [scattersmooth.R](): Smooths scatterplot. Taken from gamlss packages but fixed a couple of bugs (forgot which ones)\r\n\r\n### Scattered list: \r\n - [biplot.R](): Does what it says. Forgot where I got the original from. \r\n - [logreg.R](): Always nice to fit a logistic regression model on your own. \r\n\r\n### ggthemes:\r\nQuite a lot themes here. The only one that I actually used so far is the [tufte.R](). ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
